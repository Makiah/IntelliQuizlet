# README for IntelliQuizlet #

Welcome to the IntelliQuizlet repo!  Here, I am creating a new version of Quizlet, because I got pissed off at the lack of word processing functions available in quizlet.  Who knows where this will go?  It should help for AP classes a lot.  

### What is this repository for? ###

Uses optimization techniques to check answers rather than straight .equals() statements.
